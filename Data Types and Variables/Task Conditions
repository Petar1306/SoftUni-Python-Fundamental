1.	Concat Names
Write a program that reads two names and a delimiter. It should print the names joined by the delimiter.
Examples
Input	Output
John
Smith
->	John->Smith
Jan
White
<->	Jan<->White
Linda
Terry
=>	Linda=>Terry
Hints
•	Read the data:

•	Print:

2.	Convert Meters to Kilometers
You will be given an integer that represents a distance in meters. Write a program that converts meters to kilometers formatted to the second decimal point.
Examples
Input	Output
1852	1.85
798	0.80
Hints
•	First, we read the input number:

•	Then, we convert it to km:

•	Finally, print the number formatted to the second decimal point:

3.	Pounds to Dollars
Write a program that converts British pounds (integer) to US dollars formatted to the 3rd decimal point.
1 British Pound = 1.31 Dollars.
Examples
Input	Output
80	104.800
39	51.090
Hints
•	Read the pounds:

•	Convert them to dollars:

•	Finally, print the number formatted to the third decimal point:

4.	Centuries to Minutes
Write a program that reads an integer number of centuries and converts it to years, days, hours, and minutes.
Examples
Input	Output
1	1 centuries = 100 years = 36524 days = 876576 hours = 52594560 minutes
5	5 centuries = 500 years = 182621 days = 4382904 hours = 262974240 minutes
Hints
•	Assume that one year has 365.2422 days on average (the Tropical year).
5.	Special Numbers
Write a program that reads an integer n. Then, for all numbers in the range [1, n], print the number and if it is special or not (True / False). A number is special when the sum of its digits is 5, 7, or 11.

Examples
Input	Output
15	1 -> False
2 -> False
3 -> False
4 -> False
5 -> True
6 -> False
7 -> True
8 -> False
9 -> False
10 -> False
11 -> False
12 -> False
13 -> False
14 -> True
15 -> False
6	1 -> False
2 -> False
3 -> False
4 -> False
5 -> True
6 -> False
Hints
•	First, we read the data:

•	Iterate from 1 to n (we write n+1 because the for loop in Python iterates from 1 to n-1 by default):

•	To calculate the sum of digits of a given number num, you might repeat the following: sum the last digit
(num % 10) and remove it (sum = sum / 10) until num reaches 0.

•	Finally, print the result:

6.	Next Happy Year
You are saying goodbye to your best friend: "See you next happy year". Happy Year is the year with only distinct digits, for example, 2018. Write a program that receives an integer number and finds the next happy year.
Examples
Input	Output
8989	9012
1001	1023
